Flask-Login
-----------

Flask-Login provides user session management for Flask. It handles the common
tasks of logging in, logging out, and remembering your users'
sessions over extended periods of time.

Flask-Login is not bound to any particular database system or permissions
model. The only requirement is that your user objects implement a few
methods, and that you provide a callback to the extension capable of
loading users from their ID.
