**Your question**
Enter your question here. Please be concise and include code if necessary. If you are getting errors, please include the complete error message, including the stack trace.

**Logs**
Please provide relevant logs from the server and the client. On the server, add the `logger=True` and `engineio_logger=True` arguments to your `SocketIO()` object to get logs dumped on your terminal. The same arguments can be used on the [python-socketio's client](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/python-socketio). If you are using the JavaScript client, see [here](https://socket.io/docs/logging-and-debugging/) for how to enable logs.
